# RIS-Localisation-for-model-mismatch-analysis
This repository provides a Python framework for RIS-assisted localization analysis using the Fisher Information Matrix. It computes AEB, CRLB, and MCRLB with numerically stable methods and includes static and interactive visualizations to explore localization performance across system parameters. Designed for developers and researchers.
